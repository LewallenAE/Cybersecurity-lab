# 🦈 Wireshark Permission Setup on Parrot OS

This guide outlines the steps to configure Wireshark with proper permissions on Parrot OS without running it as the root user.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Parrot OS installed
- `sudo` privileges
- Wireshark installed

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: Verify or Create the `wireshark` Group
Check if the `wireshark` group exists:<br>
getent group wireshark

![Capture 1](screenshots/Wire_Shark_Permission_Setup/Wireshark%20Permission%20Setup%2001.png)

If it doesn't exist, create it:<br>
sudo groupadd wireshark

## 👤 Step 2: Add a User to the wireshark Group
The following code will add the current user you are logged into to the group.<br>
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER

## Step 3: Adjust Permissions for dumpcap.
sudo chgrp wireshark /usr/bin/dumpcap
sudo chmod 750 / user/bin/dumpcap<br>

**Note**<br>
750 7 gives read, write, and execute priviledges to the Owner, 5 gives read and execute priviledges to the group, and 0 means no rights to others.

sudo setcap cap_net_raw, cap_net_admin=eip /usr/bin/dumpcap

## Step 4: Verify Capabilities
getcap /usr/bin/dumpcap

If the command isn't found:
sudo find / -name getcap 2>/dev/null   (this might take a bit to complete)

Add getcap to the system path:

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Verify again:
getcap /usr/bin/dumpcap

Expected output should be:
/usr/bin/dumpcap cap_net_admin, cap_net_raw=eip
