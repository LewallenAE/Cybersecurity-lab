# üì° Capturing Packets in Wireshark Using Various Filters

## üîÑ Loopback
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Loopback (lo)
Loopback (lo) refers to packets that a machine sends to itself. Here, I selected `eth0` to capture packets from the Ethernet port.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Starting the Capture
Click the **Blue Shark Fin** (now grey in the black circle) to start capturing packets.  
![Capture 2](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2002.png)

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Stopping the Capture
Click the **Red Stop Button** (now grey) to stop capturing. If we don‚Äôt stop the capture, we can‚Äôt save it as a file.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Saving the Capture
Click the **Save** icon to store the captured packets as a file.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Opening Saved Captures
Go to **File ‚Üí Open**, choose your file, and click "Open."

## üìä Using Display Filters

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Filtering by Port
Using the filter `tcp.port == 443` displays only HTTPS (encrypted HTTP) packets.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ TCP Handshake - Client Hello
Packet from IP `52.250.42.157` shows "Client Hello," part of the TCP handshake process.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying Traffic Sources
Entering the IP address in a browser redirects to **DuckDuckGo**.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Inspecting Packet Details
Double-clicking the packet reveals source MAC (`Raspberr_81:e0:3e`), source IP, and destination IP.

## üåç IPv6 Traffic Analysis

### üîü Capturing IPv6 Packets
Visiting `http://Cygwin.com` shows an IPv6 address (`2620:52:3:1:0:246e`), using colons instead of dots like IPv4.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Recently Opened Files
Wireshark displays recently saved captures upon reopening.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Capture of **TryHackMe** shows IPv6, hidden via **Cloudflare CDN** for DDoS protection.  
![Capture 12](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2012.png)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Searching with IPv6
Entering the IPv6 address only returns search results.  
![Capture 13](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2013.png)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ CDN Effects on Accessibility
TryHackMe is referenced in search results but inaccessible directly via IP due to CDN protection.

## üîç Advanced Filtering Techniques

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Filtering "Client Hello"
Using `tls.handshake.type == 1` filters for **"Client Hello"** packets.  
![Capture 15](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2015.png)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Combining Filters with OR
Filter: `tls.handshake.type == 1 || ip.addr == 192.168.1.46` shows either condition.  
![Capture 16](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2016.png)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Excluding Packets with NOT (!)
Filter: `!(tls.handshake.type == 1) || ip.addr == 192.168.1.46` excludes "Client Hello" but includes specified IP.  
![Capture 17](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2017.png)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ Complex Filtering
Filter: `!(tls.handshake.type == 1) && (tcp.port == 443 || tcp.port == 80)` filters out "Client Hello" and shows HTTP/HTTPS traffic.  
![Capture 18](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2018.png)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Focusing on Port 80 (IPv6)
Filter: `tcp.port == 80` captures HTTP traffic with IPv6 addresses.  
![Capture 19](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2019.png)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Port 80 (IPv4)
Same filter as above but showing IPv4 traffic captured later.

## üß™ Combining Filters for Deeper Insights

### 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ HTTP/HTTPS Traffic (Including Handshake)
Shows both port 80 and 443 without excluding "Client Hello."  
![Capture 21](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2021.png)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Adding IP Filters
Filter: `(tcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443) && ip.addr == 192.168.1.46` filters traffic from/to a specific IP.  
![Capture 22](screenshots/Wireshark%20Project%2022.png)

### 2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Excluding Specific IP
Filter: `(tcp.port == 80 || tcp.port == 443) && !(ip.addr == 192.168.1.46)` excludes packets related to that IP.
