# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Lab
This repository contains cybersecurity projects conducted in my **self-built Raspberry Pi 5 Cyber Lab**.<br>
I have multiple projects and am in the process of updating this website. As I work fulltime am wanting to break into the cybersecurity profession, and am currently pursuing my Master's Degree with the University of Pennsylvania, my time is limited.<br>
I hope to have at least one project added each week.


**Projects**<br>
1. [Setting Up Parrot OS on Raspberry Pi for Cybersecurity](docs/LabSetup-Guide.md) <br>
2. [Wireshark Packet Capture and Filtering](docs/WireShark-Project.md)<br>
