# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Lab** repository.

My name is Anthony Lewallen, CC.

- I am a certified member of **ISC2™**, and the **ISC2™ Southern Arizona Chapter**, holding the **CC (Certified in Cybersecurity)** credential.

- Currently, I am pursuing the **Security+ (Sec+) certification** *(planned for March/April 2025)* and the **OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)** certification *(planned for August 2025)*.

- This space showcases various **cybersecurity projects** conducted in my self-built **Raspberry Pi 5 Cyber Lab** and through my **internship** with **Log(N) Pacific**, using tools such as **Tenable, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinal, Splunk, WireShark**, and many more.

- ** I recently upgraded to a new system which includes an **AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, Thermalright Peerless Assassin heatsink, 98 GB of G-Skill RipJaw DDR5 RAM, a Gigabyte X870 Gaming Wifi6 motherboard, a Corsair fully modular 750W power supply, POP air XL case with 4 cooling fans, and a SAMSUNG 970 EVO Plus SSD 2TB NVMe M. 2 Internal Solid State Drive.**

- I’m currently working full-time while pursuing my **Master's Degree at the University of Pennsylvania**, with a focus on breaking into the cybersecurity profession. As my time is limited, I aim to add at least **one new project each week** to this repository.
