# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Lab** repository.

- I am a certified member of **ISC2™**, and the **ISC2™ Southern Arizona Chapter**, holding the **CC (Certified in Cybersecurity)** credential.

- Currently, I am pursuing the **Security+ (Sec+) certification** *(planned for March/April 2025)* and the **OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional)** certification *(planned for July 2025)*.

- This space showcases various **cybersecurity projects** conducted in my self-built **Raspberry Pi 5 Cyber Lab** and through my **internship** with **Log(N) Pacific**, using tools such as **tenable, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Sentinal, Splunk, WireShark**, and many more. 

- I’m currently working full-time while pursuing my **Master's Degree at the University of Pennsylvania**, with a focus on breaking into the cybersecurity profession. As my time is limited, I aim to add at least **one new project each week** to this repository.
