# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Lab

Welcome to my **Cybersecurity Lab** repository. This space showcases various **cybersecurity projects** conducted in my self-built **Raspberry Pi 5 Cyber Lab**. 

I’m currently working full-time while pursuing my **Master's Degree at the University of Pennsylvania**, with a focus on breaking into the cybersecurity profession. As my time is limited, I aim to add at least **one new project each week** to this repository.
